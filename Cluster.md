A cluster is a set of computers that you configure to work together and view as a single system. The computers configured in the cluster handle the same kinds of tasks. For example, they'll all host websites, APIs, or run compute-intensive work.

A cluster uses centralized software that's responsible for scheduling and controlling these tasks. The computers in a cluster that run the tasks are called [[node]]s, and the computers that run the scheduling software are called [[controlÂ plane]]s.
